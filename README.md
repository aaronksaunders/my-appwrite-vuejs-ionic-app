### Part One
Appwrite - Build Fast. Scale Big. All in One Place.
Appwrite is a backend platform for developing Web, Mobile, and Flutter applications. Built with the open source community and optimized for a developer experience in the coding languages you love.

In this video, I'm going to show you how to get started with Appwrite  Cloud using Vue JS Ionic Framework & Capacitor including login, logout, and creating an account, working with Appwrite Cloud Instance.

I am creating vue composables for Account and AppwriteClient. Will create them for Database and Storage in part two of the video series when I cover those topics
